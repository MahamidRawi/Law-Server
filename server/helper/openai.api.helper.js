Incorporate the following details: ${additionalKeywords ? filter.clean(additionalKeywords) : 'No additional Keywords'} under the "${lawSystem}" legal system. As the case complexity increases, so should the detail and nuance of the scenario. Provide specific names, dates, and documents to maintain realism. The case format should be as follows:

{
    "title": "{plaintiff Name} vs {defendant Name}",
    "summary": "Provide a concise overview of the case, highlighting key allegations, defenses, and legal points relevant to ${fieldOfLaw} within the ${lawSystem} context. This summary is intended for the reader's initial understanding.",

}

Guidelines : 
- IMPORTANT : You must add only human in the participants (not entities / teams etc...).
- The participants array must include only the main participants, in addition to witnesses, etc...
- VERY VERY IMPORTANT : THE RESPONSE MUST HAVE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION (IN THE DISCOVERIES) FOR THE USER TO BE ABLE TO PROCEED WORKING ON THE CASE. SO CONSTRUCT IT IN A VERY INTERESTING WAY.
Guidelines:
- Make sure it's complete JSON.
- The case model must be entirely in JSON format without exceptions.
- Focus on generating a fictional yet realistic scenario, including participant names and legal documents.
- Limit "discoveries" to four items, providing extensive detail and structure without using placeholders. Include specific dates and relevant information to mimic an investigative or legal strategy game. I don't want overiew or summary of content, but ultra realistic 100% complete content with no placeholders whatsoever.
- Include only human participants in the model. Specifically,ensure no companies or non-human entities are represented in the array. For example, I don't want the United States to be in the participants. But add additional participants initially to make the case interesting. No attorney needs to be in the array of participants. Neither sides (prosecution and defense) will be in the participants array Pay attention !
- No Representing attorney should be in the participants array, not prosecution, not defense, nothing. Only participants of the case.
- Ensure the case reflects the designated complexity, realism, and legal standards accurately.

Note: While the primary focus is on the opposition attorney within the participants array, you may add more human participants following the schema provided to enhance the narrative. Ensure all details are comprehensive, leaving no information unspecified, including credit card numbers and sensitive data as required for the case's depth.

    Conduct a thorough analysis of a subpoena request directed at a specific participant in the context of the given case details. Your primary objective is to critically assess the request based on the subpoena's type, the provided justification, its relevance and coherence with the case, and compliance with legal norms and standards.

    Subpoena Request Analysis:
    - Request Type: 'Participant', specified as ${entity}.
    - Justification for Subpoena: Provided as '${justification}'.
    - Pertinent Case Details: Outlined in '${caseInfo}'.
    
    Your analysis must determine whether the subpoena request fulfills the legal criteria for issuance. This involves verifying the presence of the requested participant within the case details provided in '${caseInfo.participants}'. Should the participant be unlisted, you are tasked with creating a detailed profile for a new, plausible fictitious participant. Conversely, if the participant is already included, acknowledge their existing role within the case.
    
    The decision to grant or deny the subpoena should hinge on:
    - The coherence between the subpoena type and the justification provided.
    - The subpoena's relevance and justification in relation to the case.
    - Avoidance of redundancy by not duplicating information already available in the case details.
    - Legal and factual incoherence, or lack of substantial justification.

    {

Given the case information and the subpoena request details, the court is to decide on granting the subpoena. If the decision is to deny, provide the rationale. If granted, generate a fictitious document relevant to the case, adhering to the provided template with no placeholders, reflecting the complexity and thematic elements corresponding to the case's difficulty level.

Case Information: ${caseInfo} // This should include the case's difficulty level.
Type of Subpoena: ${type.name}
Justification: "${justification}"
Targeted Entity: "${entity}"

Evaluate the justification against the case's difficulty level. Consider the reality of legal processes, including potential corruption or other thematic elements based on the case's difficulty, to decide on granting the subpoena.
Deny the subpoena if the user is trying to mislead / manipulate / move the case in a certain direction.
Don't be easy on granting subpoenas.
